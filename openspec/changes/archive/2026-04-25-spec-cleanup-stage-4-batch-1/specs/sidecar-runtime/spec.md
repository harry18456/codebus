## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Background task error containment

Background tasks spawned by the sidecar to serve `POST /scan?stream=true`, `POST /kb/build`, and `POST /explore` SHALL run inside a wrapper that catches all exceptions, emits a single `error` event of the form `{"type": "error", "code": "<safe_code>", "message": "<safe_message>"}` to all subscribers, transitions the task `status` to `"error"`, and then closes subscriber queues. The wrapper MUST NOT include exception class names, file paths, or stack traces in the emitted `code` or `message` fields. The full exception SHALL be written to the sidecar's standard logger only. Subscribers MUST always receive either a `done` event or an `error` event before the stream closes; an open subscriber stream MUST NOT be left in a state where neither terminal event has been delivered.

The error code table SHALL be predefined (not derived from exception classes) and MUST include at minimum `"SCAN_FAILED"` (for `/scan?stream=true` failures), `"KB_BUILD_FAILED"` (for `/kb/build` failures), and `"EXPLORE_FAILED"` (for `/explore` failures). Future task kinds MUST extend the table when they are added; bare uncategorised exception text MUST NOT leak through the SSE channel.

#### Scenario: Background task exception surfaces as safe error event

- **WHEN** a background scan task raises an exception while running
- **THEN** every active subscriber MUST receive an `error` event with `code` chosen from the predefined error code table (e.g. `"SCAN_FAILED"`) and a human-readable `message` that does not include `repr(exc)`, and the task `status` MUST become `"error"`

#### Scenario: Subscriber connecting after error still observes terminal event

- **WHEN** a subscriber connects to a task that has already transitioned to `"error"`
- **THEN** the stream MUST emit the previously stored `error` event and close, rather than hanging indefinitely

#### Scenario: Explore task exception surfaces as safe error event

- **WHEN** a background explore task (created via `POST /explore`) raises an exception while running
- **THEN** every active subscriber MUST receive an `error` event with `code="EXPLORE_FAILED"` and a human-readable `message` that does not include `repr(exc)`, and the task `status` MUST become `"error"`
- **AND** the wrapper MUST NOT differentiate Explorer-specific exceptions (token budget exhausted, sandbox violation, provider error) at the SSE-channel surface — the `code` MUST stay `"EXPLORE_FAILED"` and finer-grained classification stays in the sidecar standard logger
