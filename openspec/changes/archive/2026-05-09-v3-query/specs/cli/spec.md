## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Query Subcommand Behavior

The `query` subcommand SHALL accept one positional argument `<query-text>` (the user's natural-language question) and the inherited `--repo <PATH>` (default: current working directory) and `--debug` global flags. When invoked, the subcommand SHALL execute exactly four steps in order: (1) resolve the target repository path, (2) check the vault precondition — if `<repo>/.codebus/` does not exist, exit with status 2 and emit a stderr message instructing the user to run `codebus init` first; do NOT auto-run init; (3) spawn the agent CLI with the read-only sandbox flags described below and stream child stdout and stderr to the parent process; (4) after the child terminates, exit with the child process's exit code without performing any vault auto-commit operation.

The agent spawn SHALL pass the following arguments to the agent CLI: `-p` followed by the literal string `/codebus-query "<query-text>"`; `--tools` followed by the comma-separated string `Read,Glob,Grep`; `--allowedTools` followed by the same comma-separated string; `--permission-mode` followed by `acceptEdits`. The agent's child process SHALL be invoked with the current working directory set to `<repo>/.codebus/` and its stdin SHALL be a closed stream.

The query subcommand SHALL NOT trigger raw-mirror re-sync, SHALL NOT update the vault manifest, SHALL NOT modify any file inside the vault, and SHALL NOT create any nested-git commit.

#### Scenario: Query refuses when vault is missing

- **WHEN** `codebus query "what does Foo do"` is invoked against a repository whose `.codebus/` directory does not exist
- **THEN** the subcommand SHALL exit with status 2 AND stderr SHALL contain a message instructing the user to run `codebus init` first AND no agent process SHALL be spawned

#### Scenario: Query spawns agent with cwd at vault root

- **WHEN** the query subcommand reaches its agent-spawn step against a vault rooted at `<repo>/.codebus/`
- **THEN** the agent child process SHALL be spawned with current working directory equal to `<repo>/.codebus/` AND the child SHALL receive the prompt argument `/codebus-query "<query-text>"` AND the child's stdin SHALL be closed

#### Scenario: Query passes the read-only triple-flag sandbox

- **WHEN** the query subcommand spawns the agent
- **THEN** the spawned command line SHALL include the flag pair `--tools Read,Glob,Grep`, the flag pair `--allowedTools Read,Glob,Grep`, and the flag pair `--permission-mode acceptEdits`
- **AND** the spawned command line SHALL NOT include `Write` or `Edit` in either the `--tools` or `--allowedTools` value

#### Scenario: Query does not auto-commit

- **WHEN** the query subcommand spawns the agent and the agent exits with any status code
- **THEN** the subcommand SHALL NOT call the vault auto-commit operation AND running `git -C <repo>/.codebus rev-list --count HEAD` after the query SHALL equal the same count as before the query invocation

#### Scenario: Query propagates agent exit code

- **WHEN** the query subcommand spawns the agent and the agent terminates with exit status code N (where N is any non-negative integer)
- **THEN** the query subcommand SHALL exit with status code N

#### Scenario: Query does not modify any vault file

- **WHEN** the query subcommand runs to completion against a vault with existing wiki pages
- **THEN** running `git -C <repo>/.codebus status --porcelain` after the query SHALL print no output (vault working tree clean)
